# Routing Algorithm (BFS)

This projebtc is on the basis of an routing Algorithms
and in this Project we have used BFS for our project.

## Features
This programm have following Features:
- Can add a node.
- Can remove a node.
- Can add edges.
- Can select the starting node.
- Can select the ending node.
- Shows the shortest path using highlighted color.

## Requirements
In order to run this programm you should have some softwares installed on your system like :
- JAVA jdk.
- intellij (alternatively you can also use other platforms of java.)
- java fxsdk (in order to include this in project librarires.)

## Procedure to run
- first of all include the librarires by going to project structure and then to librarires (java FXSDK).
- Now that we have set the librarires we need to modify the run configurations as we have used java FXSDK and it cannot be executed without modifying the run configurations so after navigating to run configurations add new configurations and then name it anything you wish and then click on the Main class and then click on modify options and click on VM options and in the VM options add the code like (--module-path "D:\University Data\CN LAB\CN Project Part 02\javafx-sdk-17.0.15\lib"  --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml  --enable-native-access=javafx.graphics) this has the paths of library and the jdk after setting the VM option click on apply and then click on ok and then you can easily Run it.
